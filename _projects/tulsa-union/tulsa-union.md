Tulsa Union is a high school in Oklahoma, where we developed a Metaverse version of their Tuttle Stadium on [Spatial.io](https://www.spatial.io/){: target="_blank"}. This stadium was designed to allow people to join together and watch the football game together in a social space and play various minigames with each other. This was developed alongside the [VAST Lab](https://www.vastlab.com/){: target="_blank"} at the University of Texas at Dallas.

The process of optimizing and lighting the environment for the web-based platform involved baked lighting, faked volumetrics using cones, and real time lights for the day-night switches that respond to what time of day it is at the actual location.

Because the site was hosted with Spatial.io, all game logic was coded using Unity's visual scripting. Below is the sode can toss minigame at the center of the stadium, which features automatic game starting and completing, a scrolling led high score board, and networked events for scoring points.
