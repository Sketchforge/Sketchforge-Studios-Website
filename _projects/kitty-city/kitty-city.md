The cats were modeled, rigged, and animated by an external client and then setup in Unity using custom exporting tools for Autodesk Maya for handling the rig properly.

To make the cats able to walk around the room in augmented reality, a floor plan of the gallery had to be constructed and match to the real world. Spatial anchors were used to store the location of the gallery for the experience.
