# What is Sketchforge Studios?

Sketchforge Studios is a company of like-minded, skilled creatives that work on unique projects that lie on the edge of experimental technologies, such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and games.

# Who are we?

Sketchforge was originally a community of creatives working on prototype projects together, in an attempt to test out ideas with a network of peers with differing skill sets.

Studios was founded by Daniel Martinez Murillo, Brandon Coffey, and Chris Gauthier, graduates of the [ATEC program](https://aht.utdallas.edu/degrees/undergraduate-degrees/arts-technology-and-emerging-communication/) at the University of Texas at Dallas. We are passionate about games and interactive media, the systems behind them, and their effects on the world around us.

# What do we do?

We aim to build a rapport of unique metaverse environments, digital twins, games, videos, and digital assets to burn a path towards our passions in a quickly evolving world.
We have worked on metaverse environments for [Tulsa Union High School]({{site.url}}/[projects/tulsa-union/) and Augmented Reality projects for the [New Mexico Museum of Art](https://www.nmartmuseum.org/vladem-contemporary/) in conjunction with the [UTD VAST Lab](https://www.vastlab.com/).
